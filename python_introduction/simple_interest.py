#Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:
#( I ) is the interest earned,
#( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
#( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
#( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

p = 1000
r  = 0.05 
t = 3 



interest = float(p*r*t)

print("The simple interest is: ", interest)
